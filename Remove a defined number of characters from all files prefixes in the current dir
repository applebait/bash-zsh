# For example, to remove the first 4 characters from all files prefixes in the current directory:

for f in *; do mv "$f" "${f:4}"; done

# and to remove all characters before a defined value?
for f in *; do mv "$f" "${f##*/}"; done

# being that value _part for example
$ for f in *; do mv "$f" "${f##*_part}"; done
